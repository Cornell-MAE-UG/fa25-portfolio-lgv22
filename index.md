## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Lilly Varon, and I'm a junior majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University with a passion for problem-solving and innovation. As a member of Cornell’s car racing project team, I actively apply my technical skills to real-world challenges in design, testing, and optimization. My academic focus is on developing a strong foundation in mechanics, thermodynamics, and materials science, and I’m equally driven to gain hands-on experience through internships in industries such as product design, medical devices, and advanced manufacturing.

I’m also keen on expanding my knowledge of how engineering intersects with business and finance, exploring areas like product development, risk analysis, and technological innovation. With a growth mindset and a commitment to continuous learning, I look forward to using my skills to drive impactful change and contribute to a better future.
